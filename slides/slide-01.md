# What is ReactJS

<li class="fragment">It's a JavaScript library to build user interfaces.</li>
<li class="fragment">ReactJS uses a VirtualDOM (Document Object Model) to render the page instead of manipulating the HMTL DOM directly which was a big game changer in terms of performances. Vue also uses a Virtual DOM, however Angular uses an incremental DOM which is more beneficial for double-way-binding.
<li class="fragment">It introduces the JSX markup which firts users tend to hate but you'll love it</li>
<li class="fragment">It's one-way data binding only, so all data flow always in one direction from parent to children components, but children can notify events to parent or event root components</li>
