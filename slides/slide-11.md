## Why I like ReactJS

In addition to what was said before...

<li class="fragment">It's easy, simple, and you can get started with a few lines of code without node.</li>
<li class="fragment">It can be integrated into any website and used for a single component of a complete SPA</li>
<li class="fragment">Freedom of development (although it can be a problem) and a wide market for components.</li>
<li class="fragment">Support for server-side rendering using the React Server DOM APIs from React 18 and NodeJS or frameorks like NextJS or Remix</li>
<li class="fragment">
Multiplatform:

 ðŸŒŽ Web with ReactJS
 ðŸ’» Desktop with ReactJS + Tauri or Electron
 ðŸ“± Native mobile apps with React Native
 ðŸ‘€ VR with React 360

</li>
<li class="fragment">You only need to learn HTML and Javascript</li>
