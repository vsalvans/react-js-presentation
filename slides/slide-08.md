### Functional programming benefits

<span class="fragment">**Predictability**: Because functions in functional programming do not modify state, they are predictable and easier to reason about.</span>

<span class="fragment">**Concurrency**: Functional programming makes it easier to write concurrent and parallel programs, since functions can be executed independently without affecting the state of the program.</span>

<span class="fragment">**Modularity**: The use of pure functions makes it easier to modularize code, since functions can be combined like building blocks to create more complex programs.</span>

<span class="fragment">**Testing**: Functional programming makes it easier to test code, since pure functions are deterministic and do not have side effects.</span>

<span class="fragment">**Efficiency**: Functional programming encourages the use of immutable data structures, which can be more efficient in certain cases.</span>
